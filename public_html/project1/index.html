        <h1>My Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Lily.<br> I've had an interest in coding for a while now but I didn't know what I truly wanted to do until I started talking to friends about programming. After that, I started to learn different languages through CodeCademy, hoping to see if this was something I was truly interested in.<br>I ended up falling in love with coding!<br> I'm very intrigued by the logic of programming languages, especially solving puzzles when it comes to the error codes.<br> Outside of the programming world, I have three wonderful pets: [Finn (dog), Anjuna (cat), and a Fren (lizard)] and a lovely partner. </p>
        <h1>Education/Career Goals</h1>
        <p>I am planning on figuring out ways I can best increase my coding skillset. Either learning on my own, taking classes, or joining a bootcamp. I would like to get my foot in the door in any way that I can. Once I've gotten more experience under my belt, I would like to figure out where I stand when it comes to development and work on the areas I struggle in.<br> Until then, I'm going to take it day by day and absorb as much information as I can to help achieve my goals. </p>

        <h5>These are a few of my favorite things!</h5>
        <p>I enjoy playing Video games like Elden Ring, Apex Legends, Rainbow Six Seige, Dead by Daylight, and BeatSaber. <br> My favorite thing about Music Festivals, besides the music, is meeting new people and getting to see how kind people are. My most favorite people have come into my life from music festivals. I just recently went to one in Washington called Above and Beyond Weekend Group Therapy and it has changed my life!<br> Crafternoons is such a great way to spend time with friends. We work on little projects together like: Embroidery, Making bracelets, Sewing a pocket to some overalls, Backyard projects, etc.<br> With drawing and creating art: I have tried out many different mediums and have settled on charcoal as my favorite.</p>
