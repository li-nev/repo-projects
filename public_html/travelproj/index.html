                        What's the next step? Sometimes planning a trip to the next state or out of the country can be overwhelming, especially when it's something you haven't truly done on your own. Hopefully this page can help you get started!<br>
                        Besides booking a place to stay and figuring out your flight. What are you planning on experiencing? What time of the year are you planning on going? Is the focus for your time going out into nature? Are you deciding to check something off of your bucket list? 
                        Personally, I feel like it's important to figure out what your intention is when it comes to travel and what type of travel you're about to commit to.<br>
                        There are many different forms of "vacationing"; camping, backpacking, the traditional hotel travel, etc. Depending on the travel you then determine what is important to bring and how to anticipate your trip.<br>
                        I tend to be a really organized person and depend on creating lists to make sure I'm always on top of what it is that I need to accomplish prior to a trip. I would recommend the same, especially if you're working towards a big trip. It's easy to get overwhelmed with all of the things you feel like you might need to do but it's quite easy to keep track with a list. <br>

                    <div class="column">
                        <p>Let's list out what are some possible things to consider when traveling:<br>
                            <h4>What's your Budget?</h4>
                            <p>You don't want to find yourself being low on money mid-trip especially if you have decided to do a two week trip. Planning your budget is probably one of the more important things to consider with your trip.<br>
                            Setting more money aside than your budget would probably be a nice thing to do for yourself. Of course, you can't always fully plan for how much things cost. Being able to have some flexibility in your budget is ideal.</p>
                            <h4>Consider who you're traveling with.</h4>
                            <p>Whether not it's family, partner, or friends. It's important to make sure everyone involved has communicated their expectations of the trip. Trying to figure out what everyone would like to accomplish while traveling is important to have no friction or any issues. </p>
                            <h4>Important Documents</h4>
                            <p>It's rather important to get all your papers in a row. Especially if you're planning on staying out of the country. <br>
                                For instance;
                                <strong>Passport</strong> - Having the identification for International travel. <br>
                                <strong>International Driver's License</strong> - if you've decided that your main mode of transportation is going to be driving your own vehicle. <br>
                                With the pandemic happening, some places are still pretty strict about their regulations. It might be important to have documentation of the shots you have so that you deal with the least amount of obstacles when traveling. <br>
                             </p>

                             <p>There are definitely more than just the above items to cover. 
                                <br>Like home care, animal care, and plant care.
                                Making sure that your bank knows where it is you're headed. The list goes on and on.
