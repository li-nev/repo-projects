                        <p>There is a ton of information out there that can help you figure out exactly what you need. 
                        Whether you start off with talking to some friends about the places they have traveled and the tips they have. Or possibly looking all of the information up on youtube as well as different articles on google. <br>
                    
                    The table on the right actually has some links that can help benefit your planning. 
                    
                    Airbnb is usually a place that I use for mainly stays. It's also a site that has different local experiences for the area you're going to be staying in. I haven't used it but you should definitely give it a try!<br>
                    
                    Expedia is a website I use for bundle buys. If I needd a hotel, flight and a vehicle for rent. I tend to use this website or a website similar. You're able to receive rewards points to help pay for things and also get discounts for bundle buys.<br>
                    
                    Google Travel is very similar to Expedia. Just added this site to go ahead and give a different site that might have different discounts.<br>
                
                    The US Passports link is one of the most important ones to go ahead and take a look at. Especially if you're planning to travel anywhere outside of your country.<br>
                
                    International Driving Permit is a link that provides you the ability to actually be able to use the vehicle you rent out and drive without having any issues.<br>
                
                    This information is just the tip of the iceberg. There's <strong>so</strong> many different articles, websites, and videos that could provide everything for you.</p>
