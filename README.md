<h1>Welcome to my Project Repository!</h1>
<p> I just want to be able to progress and have all of my code in one area, where I can easily see that. 
I have a few projects added into this repository. <br>
</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<h2>Project 1</h2>
<p>This is a project that I coded to showcase some tabs of other work I have done. Just a general "resume" page where I can share how I tried out different styles and approaches to HTML+CSS. Now to add Javascript code.</p>
<h2>Project 2</h2>
<p>This project was something I tried to implement what I learned with HTML, videos and sounds. AS well as more images. Have to go back and make sure this is cleared up a bit more before I start adding JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Project 3</h2>
<p>This project was something I worked on for a class to learn about accessibility reports. What the standard practices and requirements needed to be WCAG2.1 AA Compliant. </p>
<h2>Travel Project</h2>
<p>This project was to showcase the different things I've learned so far in HTML and CSS. This page I'm incredibly excited to add what I've learned in JavaScript to see how I can improve the way this page works.</p>

<p>My goal is to continue to work on these projects as well as work on the other class assignments to better showcase my progress and skill as a programmer.</p>
